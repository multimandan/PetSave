Here at PetSave our mission is to help animals find a home while giving you the opportunity to find your new best friend. Browse our current lists of pets awaiting adoption, or experience a heartwarming moment by looking at the list of recently adopted pets.

Please feel free to contact us at info@petsave.org or call us at 1-800-PET-SAVE in order to report an animal that needs to be rescued, or if you would like to proceed with adoption or if you would like to donate or volunteer with us. Click on the buttons above in order to find out more about us.
