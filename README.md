WHAT'S NEXT
-----------

These are the improvements to be put in place next:
- A front-end layer that would result in proper visualization of table contents (rescued animals, adopted animals, donations, comments).
- A back-end interface with payment systems (using Payum) which would also make PayPal donations possible.
- Finish implementing the Photo insertion/display capabilities.
- A further refining of the algorithm that evaluates regular expressions to make sure the expiry date of the credit card is in the correct format.
